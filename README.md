## Introduction

It was designed with the following considerations in mind:

- It should be run via a Github action.
- It should take a single argument, a hostname, and not require any further information about a given domain.
- The tests should behave well, so as to not overwhelm the application server.
- It should generate an XUnit artifact.
- It should also report to a Slack channel.
