blackbox
========

Introduction
------------

This is a simple test suite which runs some back black-box tests (See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-box_testing) on a given website.

It was designed with the following considerations in mind:

- It should be executed via Bamboo.
- It should be executed in a Unix environment, with Python 2.7, pip and virtualenv available.
- It should be configured by an environment variable, called `BAMBOO_DOMAIN`.
- The tests chould be throttled, so as to not overwhelm the web server.
- It should report the test results in XUnit format.

Running the tests
-----------------

- Setup the environment:

    # virtualenv env

    # source env/bin/activate

    # pip install -r etc/requirements.txt

- Then, run the tests:

    # nosetests src --with-xunit
